Bisection method is used to find the root of equations in mathematics and numerical problems. This method can be used to find the root of a polynomial equation; given that the roots must lie in the interval defined by [a, b] and the function must be continuous in this interval.
The method works by repeatedly dividing an interval in half and selecting the subinterval in which the function changes sign, and then repeating the process until the root is found.
In comparison with other root-finding methods, this method is relatively slow as it converges in a linear, steady, and slow manner.
