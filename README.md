# Root-finding-algorithms
Root-finding algorithms are mathematical and computational methods used to find the zeros or roots of continuous functions.
These algorithms involve making an initial guess and then iteratively refining that guess until the root is found. 
There are many different root-finding algorithms, including the bisection algorithm, the Newton-Raphson method, and the secant method
